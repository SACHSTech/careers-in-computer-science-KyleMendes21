## The Basics
### What does a Software Developer do?
Software developers work for computer manufacturers and firms like Google, Amazon and Microsoft. They create the base for operating systems which computer programmers use. They do a variety of things like design, write and test their code for different systems and software to make sure that is efficient. They also run quality assurance and diagnostic programs to test existing projects before they release them to ensure effectiveness. A software developer is heavily involved with the process related to designing and creating new systems from creating the plan to establishing parameters, writing, coding, designing testing and encrypting. These tasks are usually completed by a team/group of software developers. Each of the members carry out a specific step of the process and most of the time there is a supervisor who oversees the entire process. Software developers frequently use several programming languages. Their job is very complex and involves a lot of advanced knowledge in mathematics and computer science. Software developers are constantly evolving and with new technology and advancements there is a constant state of self improvement and learning. 


### Responsibilities
* Researching, planning, implementing, designing and managing different software programs
* Evaluating and testing new programs/codes
* Creating and implementing more efficient codes
* Design different pieces of a system application
* Plan how the different programs will work together
* Make sure that the programs they develop function properly through testing and maintenance
* Document everything they do to help with maintenance and upgrade down the road
* Collaborate with other people to complete a project
* Help other people with their task

### Required Education
* A bachelors degree in computer science, computer engineering, software engineering or something similar
* Majoring in computer science allowed you the  best background for becoming a software developers. The theoretical knowledge learned from computer science degrees will prepare you for the job and interview questions
* Masters degree will give your more opportunities with higher pay but it is not required
* Time is an important requirement because after about 7 years you have more knowledge increasing your pay and opportunities

### Skills
#### Knowledge of Technology
* Being able to work with different systems like Linux, Windows or IOS
- Keeping up to date with the new trends and updates within the industry
- Understanding what hardware is required for a programs to run
- Being proficiency when using different languages

#### Detailed Oriented
- Being able to detect what creates an error in your code
- A single line of code could ruin your whole application

#### Problem Solving Skills
- Most of the time you have to solve different problems
- Being able to figure out what is creating an error in your cod
- Solving the issues or errors in a timely manner

#### Multitasking
- Being able to work on multiple projects at once
- Being able to evaluate a variety of issues at the same time

#### Responsible
- Being able to be on time with deadlines
- Being able to attend meeting

#### Communication 
- Being able to communicate with your coworkers and team
- Being able to communicate your ideas to different people
- Being able to inform your teammate about any issues or bugs

It introduces the design and analysis of algorithms, the management of information, and the programming mechanisms and methodologies required in implementations. Topics discussed include iterative and recursive sorting algorithms; lists, stacks, queues, trees, and their application; abstract data types and their implementations.
- Math 136 - Linear Algebra 1: Systems of linear equations, matrix algebra, elementary matrices, computational issues. Real n-space, vector spaces and subspaces, basis and dimension, rank of a matrix, linear transformations, and matrix representations. Determinants, eigenvalues and diagonalization, applications.
- Math 138 - Calculus 2: Introduction to the Riemann integral and approximations. Antiderivatives and the fundamental theorem of calculus. Change of variables, methods of integration. Applications of the integral. Improper integrals. Linear and separable differential equations and applications. Tests for convergence for series. Binomial series, functions defined as power series and Taylor series. Vector (parametric) curves in R2. Suitable topics are illustrated using computer software.
- Two Electives
 
#### Graduation Requirements
- Under Required Courses and Electives, check off the forty unique courses (20.0 units) that you have earned university credit for. Additional Elective Units can be any course for which you received university credit.
- Verify that the Required Courses and Electives also satisfy the Additional Constraints.
- Depending on your specific program you might have to complete 6 terms of coop
 
#### Program Length
Usually the program length is 4 years but if you are taking coop it will take 5 years
